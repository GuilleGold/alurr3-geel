# AluraGeek Frontend Challenge Project

This is my project for the Frontend challenge proposed by Oracle Next Education and Alura LATAM.

## Challenge Description

The challenge involves creating an online store based on the [FIGMA file](https://www.figma.com/file/AB8pEp5K7lo7xUYjQwdfYA/AluraGeek-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=PGhF0WdsaFdfVfJV-1) provided. While we are expected to follow the design in the FIGMA file, we also have the freedom to customize it to our liking.

One of the key requirements is to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using HTTP requests. This means we should be able to manage and manipulate products within our store, including reading, creating, deleting, and editing them.
